#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am currently in the second year of my Masterâ€™s in Data Science, a program jointly offered by the University of Lille, Ã‰cole Centrale Lille, and IMT Nord Europe in Lille, France. In 2023, I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science with honors at the Holy Spirit University of Kaslik in Kaslik, Lebanon. My main interest lies in working with data and applying Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to solve complex real-world problems. During the summer of 2024, I completed a three-month internship at the INFINITE Laboratory (Institute for Research on Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases), which is part of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Lille, I developed advanced Convolutional Neural Networks to classify anomalies in images of Anti-Nuclear Antibodies. The resulting model achieved an impressive 96% accuracy and was successfully deployed on the CHU server, enabling automated diagnostics to assist medical professionals. While the medical field was an incredible experience, I am also eager to apply my skills and knowledge to challenges in other industries, driving innovation through data and AI.
